# Sipsey Wilderness (Alabama) Complete GPX Map for Hikers 

Sipsey Wilderness is a wilderness area withing the Bankhead National Forest, with beautiful trails, boulders, creeks, rivers, and waterfalls. This is a comprehensive map of all waypoints (trailheads, waterfalls, campsites, boulders, attractions etc.) and tracks (from 200 to 224) by patching together public info I found online, info I gathered from my own trips, and using the OSM & GPXstudio.

You can use the GPX map with any hiking app that allows GPX imports. I prefer to use the free & open source Comaps app. Below is how the map looks in GPXstudio:

Below is how it looks in the Comaps. In the GPX file, I included specific color coding information (unique to Comaps) for different waypoints: 
brown: campsites
orange: rock shelters (in case one needs shelter from rain, when caught without a tent)
blue: falls & water sources 
green: attractions (boulders etc.),
gray: parking/trailheads

For other apps, information for the waypoints were included as symbols (so that you can see a camp symbol for campsites etc.)

Please use the map with caution. I tried my best to get the most accurate information, but there might be inaccurate information on the map. Use it at your own risk. I will be updating it after each trip, and will post the most up-to-date version.
